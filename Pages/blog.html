          <P>The mausoleum in Agra, Taj Mahal, is Indiaâ€™s most famous monument and a shrine of timeless love. Built between 1632 and 1653 AD by Shahjahan, the 5th Mughal Emperor of the Mughal Dynasty, it took 21 years and 32 crore rupees to come up with this epitome of true love and passion. Its pristine white marble shines brilliantly through the sun rays providing for a visual masterpiece. Taj Mahal was declared as UNESCO world heritage site in 1983 and has been a winner of several laurels ever since.</P></center>
